# Heat Buddies Fictional Product
I absolutely had nothing to do with the product name or idea.

## What is this?
This is a project created for school. The project was to design
a website for a fictional project. I'd say I did pretty well =)

## Where'd you get those images?
Basically I copied them off the images tab when searching for them.
I got photos from iPhoto, Clipart library, and Openclipart.

## Can you tell me anything else?
I just created this section so I could write crap but this was made mainly to learn the React
Javascript framework. School gave me the idea, but I would've done something similar without it.
This project is unfinished, and I will likely keep brushing it up until the end of time. If I don't,
I forgot about it. I licensed this under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, like I do to all my projects.
